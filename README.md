# Segmentation_tool_tongue_mucosa

These Matlab scripts make it possible to autosegment the taste bud bearing tongue mucosa in head and neck CTs. Nescessary inputs are the CT, Dose distribution and segmentation of the oral cavity. 
Script A1 is run first as a preprocessing step to make the handling of larger datasets easier. A2 will create the Tongue mucosa structure from the oral cavity by process of erosion.
